1. Cloud Computing - Cloud Computing is the delivery of IT resources over the Internet. The cloud is like a virtual data center accessible via the Internet that allows you to manage:

   - Storage services likes databases
   - Servers, compute power, networking
   - Analytics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality
   - Security services for data and applications

2. Characteristics of Cloud Computing
   - Pay as you go - You pay only for what you use and only when your code runs.
   - Autoscaling - The number of active servers can grow or shrink based on demand.
   - Serverless - Allows you to write and deploy code without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.


3. Types of Cloud Computing

   - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): The provider supplies virtual server instances, storage, and mechanisms for you to manage servers. e.g. AWS

   - Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): A platform of development tools hosted on a provider's infrastructure. e.g. GoDaddy

   - Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): A software application that runs over the Internet and is managed by the service provider. e.g. gmail


4. Cloud computing Deployment model

   - Public Cloud: A public cloud makes resources available over the Internet to the general public.

   - Private Cloud: A private cloud is a proprietary network that supplies services to a limited number of people.

   - Hybrid Cloud: A hybrid model contains a combination of both a public and a private cloud.

5. Benefits: There are several benefits to the cloud.


   - Stop guessing about capacity.
   - Avoid huge capital investments up front.
   - Pay for only what you use.
   - Scale globally in minutes.
   - Deliver faster.

6. Cloud Based Products: Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of global cloud-based products.

7. Global Infrastructure

   - Region: A region is considered a geographic location or an area on a map.

   - Availability Zone: An availability zone is an isolated location within a geographic region and is a physical data center within a specific region.

   - Edge Location: An edge location is as a mini-data center used solely to cache large data files closer to a user's location.

   - Additional Information
	- There are more Availability Zones (AZs) than there are Regions.
	- There should be at least two AZs per Region.
	- Each region is located in a separate geographic area.
	- AZs are distinct locations that are engineered to be isolated from failures.

8. Shared Responsibility Model: AWS is responsible for security OF the cloud, we are responsible for security IN the cloud.


   - Examples
	- AWS is responsible for:
		- Securing edge locations
		- Monitoring physical device security
		- Providing physical access control to hardware/software
		- Database patching
		- Discarding physical storage devices

	- You are responsible for:
		- Managing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
		- Encrypting data
		- Preventing or detecting when an AWS account has been compromised
		- Restricting access to AWS services to only those users who need it
