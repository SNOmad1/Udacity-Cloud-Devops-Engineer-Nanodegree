1. Security In The Cloud: As adoption of cloud services has increased, so has the need for increased security in the cloud. The great thing about cloud security is that it not only protects data, it also protects applications that access the data. Cloud security even protects the infrastructure (like servers) that applications run on. The way security is delivered depends on the cloud provider you're using and the cloud security options they offer.

2. AWS Shield: AWS Shield is a managed DDoS (or Distributed Denial of Service) protection service that safeguards web applications running on AWS.


	- AWS Shield is a service that you get "out of the box", it is always running (automatically) and is a part of the free standard tier. If you want to use some of the more advanced features, you'll have to utilize the paid tier.

	- Tips
		- AWS Shield can be found under the Security, Identity, & Compliance section on the AWS Management Console.
		- AWS Shield Standard is always-on, using techniques to detect malicious traffic.
		- AWS Shield Advanced provides enhanced detection.
		
3. AWS WAF: AWS WAF (or AWS Web Application Firewall) provides a firewall that protects your web applications. WAF can stop common web attacks by reviewing the data being sent to your application and stopping well-known attacks.


	- Tips
		- WAF is found under the Security, Identity, & Compliance section on the AWS Management Console.
		- WAF can protect web sites not hosted in AWS through Cloud Front.
		- You can configure CloudFront to present a custom error page when requests are blocked.
		
4. Identity & Access Management: Identity & Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that allows us to configure who can access our AWS account, services, or even applications running in our account. IAM is a global service and is automatically available across ALL regions.

	- Security Concepts
		- User
		- IAM Group
		- IAM Role
		- Policy
		
5. Security in the Cloud
In this hands-on exercise, you will create an IAM policy and review the generated JSON.

	- Prerequisites:
	    - AWS account
	- Topics Covered:
	    - By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

			- Create an IAM policy using the visual editor.

	- Steps:
		a) Create a Policy
			- On the AWS Management Console page, type IAM in the Find Services box and then select IAM.
			- Click on Policies on the left-hand side.
			- Click Create policy.
			- Next to Service, click Choose a service.
			- In the selection box, type S3.
			- Select S3.
			- Specify the actions allowed in S3 by clicking on List.
			- Expand the Read action by clicking on the arrow next to it, then select GetObject.
			- Next in the Resources section, ensure Specific is selected, and select the Any checkboxes next to bucket and object.
			- Then click on Review policy.
			- Enter a name for your policy in the Name box.
			- Then click on Create policy.
		b) Review Policy
			- After your policy is created, enter the name of the policy you just created in the Filter policies text box.
			- Click on the name of your policy.
			- Review the JSON for the policy you just created on the Permissions tab.
			- Click on the Policy usage tab to see if this policy is in use. Notice this policy is not attached to any resources yet.
